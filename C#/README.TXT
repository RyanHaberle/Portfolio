While at George Brown we were enrolled in 2 C# classes during semester 2 and semester 3

Semester 2: Our first real programming assignment. It was a Console based 
application where a user could put data in for any number of centres and track highs and lows of averages based on attendance and revenue.

Semester3 Assignment: Using lists we had to place items into bags and save the data to text files using various functions.
