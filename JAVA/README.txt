While Learning Java In the third semester we had to create Two exciting projects that helped with our understanding of classes and inheritance.

Assignment one: we used plain Java to create a simple App where you can add banking accounts and deposit and withdraw different ammounts of money.

Assignment 2: The same as assignment one except we used Java Fx to make a user interface to interact with the accounts.
