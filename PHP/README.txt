During Semester 3 I had the chance to do two fun projects in PHP. 

Assignment 1: Build a contact address book in PHP 

Assignment 2: Group Project - Our group built a simple web app that could be used to check which labs have what software. If a student needed different software, they could request an install or an update from the admins. 
PHPMyAdmin and SQL were use for all the CRUD Operations.
