During Semester 5 and 6 we have been working on our final project.

We chose the application, planned it and built it. It has been a great experience where I got to work with a team of my peers that I learned so much from.

During the project we have had to meet sprint deadlines every 2-3 weeks.

The project we chose was a Social media site that revolves around culture. It is a site designed to help people moving to or visiting a country new to them understand cultures of those countries. It is also to help people new to a city find groups that align with their beliefs.
