Our first Full Stack Dev course was in semester 5. We used the MEAN stack and built an application that would allow users to reserve movies. The admin can log in and add and delete movies from the Database.

Our Semester 6 Full Stack Dev course uses the MERN stack. Our final Project is to learn SOCKET.IO and build a chat application.
I am still in the process of this project and have built the back end and socket.IO chat. I will update it when React is implemented.
